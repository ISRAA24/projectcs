    <b>
    <p1 >
Recent emergencies, such as school shootings and dangerous 
weather, have increased attention on ways organizations can 
quickly and effectively notify a large number of individuals. 
Following the Virginia Tech tragedy in 2007, which involved a 
shooting rampage lasting about two hours and killing more than 30 
individuals, the Higher Education Opportunity Act was signed into 
law. The law provides grants and other assistance to colleges and 
universities to create an emergency communications system that 
can be used to contact students when a signifi cant emergency 
or dangerous situation emerges.

  <p2>
In response, colleges across the 
United States are implementing emergency notification systems <mark>to 
notify students, faculty, staff, and campus visitors of an emergency, 
severe weather condition, campus closure, or other critical event.</mark>
Because nearly all college students in the United States today 
have mobile phones, sending emergency alerts via text message 
is a natural option. </p2>
</br>
 <p3>
To be able to send a text message to an entire 
campus typically requires the use of a company that specializes in this type of mass communications. One such company is 
Omnilert, which has systems installed in more than 800 colleges 
and universities around the country. With the Omnilert campus 
notifi cation system called e2 Campusthe contact information 
of the students, faculty, and staff to be notifi ed is entered into 
the system and then the individuals can be divided into groups, 
depending on the types of messages each individual should 
receive. Individuals can also opt in to alerts via text message. 
When an alert needs to be sent, an administrator sends the message (via a mobile phone or computer) and it is distributed to  
 the appropriate individuals (see the accompanying illustration).
</p3>
</br>
 <p4>
In addition to text messages, alerts can also be sent simultaneously 
and automatically via virtually any voice or text communications 
medium, such as:
<ul>
 <li>voice messages</li>
 <li>e-mail messages</li> 
 <li>RSS feeds</li>  
<li>instant messages</li>
<li> Twitter feeds</li><li>Facebook pages</li>  
<li>school Web pages</li>
 <li>personal portal pages</li>
 <li>desktop pop-up alerts</li>   
 <li>TTY/TDD devices</li> 
 <li>digital signage systems (such as signs located inside dorms and the student union)</li> 
 <li>indoor and outdoor campus public address (PA) systems</li>
  <li>information hotlines</li>
  and more
</ul>

To facilitate campus emergency notification systems, some 
colleges now require all<mark> undergraduate students</mark> to have a mobile 
phone. Some campuses also implement other useful mobile services, such as tracking campus shuttle buses, participating in 
class polls, accessing class assignments and grades, and texting 
tips about suspicious activities or crimes to campus security. An 
additional safety feature available at some schools is the ability 
to use the phones to activate an alert whenever a student feels 
unsafe on campus; these alerts automatically send the student's 
physical location (determined via the phone's GPS coordinates) 
to the campus police so the student can be located quickly.
